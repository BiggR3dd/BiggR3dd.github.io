        <p>As you can imagine going to a sporting event is one of my favorite things to do! Unfortunately I have never been able 
            to make my way over to the great Fenway Park! I mean just look at it in all of it's glory! With that being said, I 
            would be remised if I didn't provide you with some tools to get yourself to a game after I spent all this time trying
            to convince you how great it is to be a Sox fan.
