		<h2>Life at Home</h2>
		<p><strong>I am currently serving in the Air Force and live with my two puppies, 
			wife, and 7 mos old 
			son. I really do not have too many hobbies, but the two hobbies
			I spend most of my time participating in are watching sports and playing videogames.

		<h3>How It All Began</h3>	
		<p>As a child I did not have a ton of influence in my hobbies, mostly becasue my parents always 
			were working and they also weren't really into sports. I however was fascinated and completely 
			enamored by the idea that someone could play a sport for a living. Making a really good living 
			at that too. One of the first memories I have of being interested in sports was reading a 
			newspaper article discussing the baseball <strong>World Series.</strong> At the time I wasn't 
			playing baseball anymore because my parents didn't have the money to get me signed up anymore 
			after my first year of slow-pitch/T-ball. I read this story about a team in Boston, Massachusetts 
			that waited 86 years between winning the championship. I thought how incredible would that be to 
			root for a team that long and then have them finally win it all.</p>

			srcset="Images/cornfield-200.png   206w,     Images/cornfield-400.png 412w,   Images/cornfield-600.png   618w"
			sizes="(max-width: 480px) 60vw,      (max-width: 960px) 30 vw,      30vw"></picture></p>

			<p>Next thing I knew I would come 
				home from school and frequently visit <a href="https://www.mlb.com/redsox">The Red Sox homepage,</a> 
				trying to get the latest news about the team I had completely become <em>obsessed</em> with. 
				I was instantly hooked on sports and the inspiration that it stirred inside of me. Today I still 
				root for the Boston Red Sox, and in fact I am watching them in an elimination game right now as I 
				create this website.</p>
