        <p>As a longtime Red Sox fan you have learned to have your heart broken a 
            few times, and you know everything won't alway be pretty. As you can see in the 
            video above, sometimes everything is going great and then other times, as you can 
            see below, it's not going so great. 
        </p>

        <h2>Umpire Laz Diaz Blows A Third Strike Call In Game 4 Of The 2021 ALCS</h2>

        <p>While being a Red Sox fan can certainly be painful at times, I would say there are 
            few things that are more fun than rooting for this team. Which really has a whole lot less 
            to do with the team and actually has to do with the communities that surround this team.

            This is why I was hoping you made it this far into my website. I wanted to introduce you to

            Podcast.</a> This podcast has been my backbone of Sox talk for a while now. It always feels like
            I'm hanging out with a couple of pals. I am incredibly confident once, you just give one episode
            a listen you will totally understand what I mean.
