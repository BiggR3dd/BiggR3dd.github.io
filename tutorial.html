            <h1>Make My Famous Spicy Pasta!</h1>

            <p>This recipe is one of my all time favorite meals whenever I have a small party
                over to the house for the game. It goes great with craft beer, or wine, or 
                whatever really. It's easy and filling, everything you could want for a big game.

            <p><strong>Step 1</strong><br>
            Start by browning the sausage in a large pot, while begining to boil 6 quarts of water</p>

            <p><strong>Step 2</strong><br>
            Once the sausage is thoroughly cooked through, and your water has begun to boil,
            add your noodles to the water, and 4tbsp of butter plus 1 cup of heavy cream to
            the sausage</p>

            <p><strong>Step 3</strong><br>
            Your noodles should cook for 10 mins, no longer than 12 mins</p>

            <p><strong>Step 4</strong><br>
            When the cream and butter starts to simmer with the sausage, start adding parmesean
            cheese a little bit at a time, you will add about 1 cup to 1 and a half cups of cheese
            while you wait for the noodles to finish</p>

            <p><strong>Step 5</strong><br>
            Add your seasonings, (Red Pepper Flake, Salt, Pepper), until it tastes right to you</p>

            <p><strong>Step 6</strong><br>
            As soon as the noodles are done, strain them and then add the noodles to your sauce 
            mixture a little bit at a time, add a little more parmesean cheese, and then serve</p>

            <h3>All Done! Yummy!!</h3>
